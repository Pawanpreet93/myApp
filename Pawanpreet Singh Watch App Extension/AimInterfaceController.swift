After that there was no looking back.  I always create short term goals and aim to fulfill them.\n\nTalking about my long term goals, being a social work lover, me and my friend have planned of making a free multi-speciality hospital only for poor people in my city. Now about my field that is Development, I have aimed to involve people from the Slum area, make them learn and be employed. I feel that if a person is having a good skill set and good logic building then he/she can develop anything and you never know that can be the Next Steve Jobs!!")
        
        label2.setText("Working on my dream, I celebrated my 21st birthday by spending time in slums and helped them in realising the importance of education. I also participated in Technical Fest to raise funds and with that I adopted 4 orphans and now I funded their study and schooling expenditure for two years.\n\nDescribing a bit more about me is my \"daily goal setting\" habit. This includes making someone around me happy or at least make them smile.")
